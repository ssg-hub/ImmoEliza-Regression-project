## Objective
To create a Machine Learning Regression project based on real data for Belgian housing market. 

## Description
Our application will build various types of Regression models and predict approximate prices for properties in Belgium. This Machine Learning application is based on **Streamlit** library of Python. It gives the user the possibility to choose between **Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia** regions and **houses, apartments, offices and industry** property types. Outliers removal option and hyperparameter tuning for regression models are key feature of our project application. For performance analysys, a comparative study between **Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression and Random Forest Regression** models is presented on basis of error between predictions and real data.

## Running
[Belgian Housing Market Prediction App](https://share.streamlit.io/ssg-hub/immoeliza-regression-project/main)

## Installation 
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the required libraries

## Methodology
We used the data scraped from the real estate website ([Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/en)) for more than 12,000 properties. The data was then preprocessed to remove duplicates and none values. Exploratory Data Analysis was done and on basis of correlation we selected 'Area' as the feature to determine our target the 'Price'.
